# assesmentAssesor
For easiest use, put the executable in the assesmentAssesor folder and run python assesor.py -d -e EXENAME.exe      (or EXENAME   for mac/linux (without the .exe))

I have tested this on windows with python 3.8 and a mac with python 2.7. Both should be working, although tkinter was not working well with the mac one, not sure if it was because of python 2.7 or mac, so probably best just to stick with the command line for now.
